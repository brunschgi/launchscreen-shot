# The Why.

Native & bookmarked apps need launch screens in .png format.
It can be quite cumbersome to make launch screens for dozens different resolutions and/or languages.
On the other hand it would be very easy to implement the correct look and feel in a responsive manner.

The launchscreen-shot utility generates .png screenshots from your launchscreens for all desired resolutions.
